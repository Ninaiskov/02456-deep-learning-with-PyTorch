    "In this lab, we will introduce different ways of learning from sequential data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a recurring example, we will train neural networks to do language modelling, i.e. predict the next token in a sentence. In the context of natural language processing a token could be a character or a word, but mind you that the concepts introduced here apply to all kinds of sequential data, such as e.g. protein sequences, weather measurements, audio signals, or videos, just to name a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "To really get a grasp of what is going on inside a recurrent neural network (RNN), we will carry out a substantial part of this exercise in Nanograd rather than PyTorch. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start off with a simple toy problem, build an RNN using Nanograd, train it, and see for ourselves that it really works. Once we're convinced, you will implement the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell, also in Nanograd. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is *not* simple but with the DenseLayer class we already have, it is doable. Having done it yourself will help you understand what happens under the hood of the PyTorch code we will use throughout the course.\n",

    "In previous labs we mainly considered data $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d$ is the feature space dimension.\n",
    "With time sequences our data can be represented as $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d}$, where $t$ is the sequence length. \n",
    "This emphasises sequence dependence and that the samples along the sequence are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\n",
    "\n",
    "With RNNs, we can model both many-to-one functions: $\\mathbb{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^c$ and many-to-many functions: $\\mathbb{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, c}$, where $c$ is the amount of classes/output dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to represent sequences. With text, the challenge is how to represent a word as a feature vector in $d$ dimensions, as we are required to represent text with decimal numbers in order to apply neural networks to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will use a simple one-hot encoding but for categorical variables that can take on many values (e.g. words in the English language) this may be infeasible. For such scenarios, you can project the encodings into a smaller space by use of embeddings. If you want to learn more about tokens, encodings and embeddings than what is covered in this exercise, we highly recommend [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEMJRjEdNzM&list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z)."

Since the RNN has been trained on a dataset with sequences that contain the same amount of a's and b's, always starts with an a and ends with EOS. Therefore, we would expect that the extrapolation will also have this \"pattern\". In all examples the predicted sequence starts with a and ends with EOS as expected. The number of a's and b's are somewhat equal (not perfect)."

To combat these issues the gated hidden units were created. The two most prominent gated hidden units are the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), both of which have shown increased performance in saving and reusing memory in later timesteps. In this exercise, we will focus on LSTM but you would easily be able to go ahead and implement the GRU as well based on the principles that you learn here.\n",

    "As we have already seen, RNNs are excellent for sequential data such as language. But what do we do if we're modelling data with strong dependency in both directions? Like in many things deep learning, we can build powerful models by stacking layers on top of each other; *bi-directional* RNNs consist of two LSTM cells, one for each direction. A sequence is first fed into the forward LSTM cell and the reversed sequence is then used as input to the backward LSTM cell together with the last hidden state from the forward LSTM cell. Follow [this link](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4b80/89bc9b49f84de43acc2eb8900035f7d492b2.pdf) for the original paper from 1997(!).\n",
    "\n",
    "For even deeper representations, multiple layers of both uni-directional and bi-directional RNNs can be stacked ontop of each other, just like feed-forward and convolutional layers. For more information on this, check out the [LSTM PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#lstm). Next week we will also explore ways to combine RNNs with other types of layers for even more expressive function approximators."
